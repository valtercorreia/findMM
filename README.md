# CSGO PT Finder

The twitch chat at twitch.tv/zorlakoka is a place where many portuguese CSGO players post their steam id looking for players of the same rank to play some matches.
This experimental web app reads that chat, looking for those messages and organizes them, making it easier to find players.
